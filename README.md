# SpacePointer
An Arduino controlled astrolabe

# About
This is a space pointer!

It lets you select a planet, and time of day, and the arrow will spin around to point to its position in the sky.

You need an Arduino, two motors, an LCD, and some wire.

This is the source to a very simple project, and can be completed in a couple of hours. The computation of the planet positions are done offline and copied into the Arduino source code, thereby simplifying the code required.
